# 👋 Hello, I’m Peter Okiokpa, 
An AI Engineer, Technical Content Writer, and passionate advocate for Robotics and AI Engineering. I specialize in developing AI-driven solutions, creating clear and actionable technical content, and empowering the next generation of tech enthusiasts through education and advocacy.

With hands-on experience in robotics and AI, I founded Roemai, a venture dedicated to the education, innovation, and advocacy of Robotics and AI Engineering across Nigeria and Africa. Through Roemai, I aim to bridge the technology skills gap, empower young minds, and foster socio-economic growth in the region. I also co-manage and tutor at Softmatic Academy, where we provide training in coding, robotics, and AI to equip future tech enthusiasts with the practical skills they need to thrive.
